Royal Enfield Bikes
Royal Enfield bike price starts from Rs. 1,49,900. Royal Enfield offers 13 new models in India with most popular bikes being Hunter 350, Classic 350 and Continental GT 650. The upcoming bikes of Royal Enfield include Classic 650, Himalayan 750 and Scrambler 450. Most expensive Royal Enfield bike is Super Meteor 650, which is priced at Rs. 3,63,900.
Royal Enfield is one of the oldest surviving motorcycle manufacturers in the world. It was known for its old school styling and played a big role in World War. In 1994, Eicher Motors acquired Royal Enfield and started working on an entirely new line-up of motorcycles. While the company continued to make classic and old-school motorcycles till 2017, its brand new portfolio started coming up in 2017 and that helped the brand bring in a lot more buyers into the brand – in India as well as abroad.
Currently, Royal Enfield sells motorcycles in three primary segments – 350cc, 450cc and 650cc. In the 350cc segment, the company is selling a total of four different motorcycles and this number will increase in a few months. On the other hand, the 450cc class is new for the company and there will be at least half a dozen more bikes that the company will launch in the next few years. Royal Enfield is an extremely strong line-up in the 650cc range, and there’s high chance of more bikes to be launched here.
The main reasons Royal Enfield is doing so well in India is due to its brand image and what that brand stands for. All Royal Enfield bikes have a character that is completely different from the bikes that are sold in India. The combination of modern retro styling, an engine with good torque and lots of brand value makes Royal Enfield one of the best motorcycle brands in the world. Even though the company has stuck to its heritage, it has adopted a lot of new and modern technologies. It is one of the few companies to introduce a full-colour TFT instrument cluster on an adventure bike. Plus, this screen also supports Google Maps with navigation and traffic detail. These new features are likely to make their way to more motorcycles in the future.
Royal Enfield also has plans to launch electric motorcycles. For now, there is not concrete details on this, but the first electric RE is likely to come in 2027.

Royal Enfield Hunter 350
Hunter is tunder of bikes
1 day ago
Abrar
Using since 1 year and my overall idea about this bike is satisfied it's value for money and as we all know Royal Enfield is the brand and dream for many youths. On my side, it's a must to buy especially for college-going students with a distance of about 15-20 km as it gives only 35 km. Overall look and design are awesome

Royal Enfield Classic 350
Made like a gun goes like a bullet
1 day ago
Akash Kumar
Royal Enfield Classic 350

This provides a really comfortable ride and is really meant for long-distance traveling. 
The backrest makes it even more comfortable for the person sitting on the bike.
 In terms of mileage, 
it gives an average of 30 - 35 kmpl as per my experience.
To kick things off, I'd just like to say that my Classic 350 is probably the most aesthetically pleasing and comfortable bike I've ever had as a daily commuter. Its old-school charm, full fenders, and ""nearly"" perfect neutral seated riding position keeps a smile on my face day after day.

The Royal Enfield Continental GT 650 is a stylish, well-built cafe racer with a refined engine and engaging performance. I love retro aesthetics with modern reliability, this bike is a great choice at a competitive price point. At this time this bike is like a dream for Indian youth and turning adults. I am in love with this, If a few more things can be better it will be a beast on the road with rider safety, major with chrome finishing, and handle throttling, sometimes it's on full fuel tank but shows no fuel. As a cafe racer, it's my love.

Royal Enfield Bullet 350
There is no word to explain,, it's things to feel.
1 day ago
Malay Das
Most perfect and comfortable bikes at low cost and at your budget. This bike feels like that by its slogan only. It builds like a gun and goes like a bullet. Most comfortable, and attractive at looking... feels like royal...and its body width like you are riding an elephant on the road at the top speed of 100

Royal Enfield Meteor 350
Worst Experience on service and Brake Pad performance
1 week ago
Dinesh
The brake pad doesn’t withstand for 3 months and for the 2k Km so the new buyers who wish to buy RE Meteor 350 get ready to change their brake pad for every 2k KM but your service interval appears only every 5k KM once. Worst quality on key product (brake pad) and RE is not ready to consider the basic safety of the riders.
